In our startup, we were using WordPress as a content publishing platform. Working with a team of people we found monday.com could be a great tool to manage the publishing, collaborate, and keep everything on track. So, we set-up a Monday board with automation and workflow that was suited for us. Monday soon we realized there was a lot of back and forth between Monday and WordPress in which users had to manually update things.
We saw this as an opportunity and started integrating with Monday API V2. As we built it on top of WordPress, we realized that we can actually extract the core and make it an open service for anyone using WordPress. 


## Introduction
This integration lets users synchronize there WordPress site with Monday to create efficient workflows and automation. Monday users can synchronize posts, pages, users, comments, and taxonomies from WordPress to Monday and vice versa. This opens a new window of automation opportunity for publishers, content creators, or simply anyone using WordPress to create custom workflows and connect various other platforms without any additional plugin installation on WordPress.

>  ......  Many more integrations coming soon.


## How it works?
The integration uses Monday V2 API with Authorization, custom triggers and actions, and WordPress Rest API. Since WordPress users can have any site, so to have a standard backend app, we have created a middleware application between Monday and WordPress that runs all the transaction on Standard URL‚Äôs. Price yet to be decided.


## Getting Started

Users will also need to install an additional WordPress plugin on their WordPress website and enter asked details during integration.
